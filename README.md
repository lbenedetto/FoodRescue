# FoodRescue
Team project for EWU Senior Project class, in which students are tasked with building a product for a client.

In this case, our client was EWU Dining Services, who wanted an app for notifying students of free food available after catered events.

Our project was split into 3 parts
* An Android app, for sending and receiving announcements
* A web interface, for sending announcements
* An SMS subscription, for receiving announcments
